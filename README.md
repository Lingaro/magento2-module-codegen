# Magento 2 Code Generator

Created by [Orba](https://orba.co)

Inspired by https://github.com/staempfli/magento2-code-generator

## Purpose

In day-to-day Magento 2 development there are some common tasks which require development of repeatable code that is hard to simply copy-paste.
The purpose of this app is to automatize creation of such code, so the developers may focus on business logic and thanks to that being much more efficient and happy.

There are other tools on the market that allows to generate Magento boilerplate code, but we went a step further.
The unique value of our tool is that it can be used with already existing codebase.
The code generated by the tool is automatically merged with current code (eg. configuration XML files, requirejs-config JS files, etc.).
Also, our aim was to generate high-quality code that uses modern PHP features and Magento coding standards.

## Demo

New entity with all admin CRUD actions in just a minute? Why not ;-)

## Installation

Recommended way to install this app is to add it as Magento's Composer dev dependency:

```
composer require --dev orba/magento2-codegen
```

If you don't want to attach this app to your Magento, you can also simply clone the repository and use it as a standalone library.
Don't forget to run `composer install` to install all required dependencies.

## Configuration

Create your custom config file (not needed for Orba developers) either in package `config` directory or in your Magento root directory:

```
cp vendor/orba/magento2-codegen/config/codegen.yml.dist vendor/orba/magento2-codegen/config/codegen.yml
```
or
```
cp vendor/orba/magento2-codegen/config/codegen.yml.dist codegen.yml
```

and edit default values.

You may add your own template directory by including the following in your `codegen.yml`: 

```
templateDirectories:
  - { path: "path/to/templates" }
```

Template folder `path` must be relative to package directory, ex. if you want to add private templates to your Magento `dev` folder, you should use `../../../dev/codegen_templates` path.

You may include multiple template directories.

To overwrite a core template just copy a core template to your template directory and make changes as necessary.

## Usage

1. List all templates:

```
bin/codegen template:list
```

2. Show template info:

```
bin/codegen template:info <template>
```

3. Generate template:

```
bin/codegen template:generate <template>
```

For templates which type is `module` (most of them) this command must be executed on the module root folder where the `registration.php` file is.

For templates which type is `root` this command must be executed on the Magento root folder.

Example:

```
cd /path/to/magento/app/code/Orba/TestModule
../../../../vendor/bin/codegen template:generate block
```
